The aim of this practical is to develop a basic calculator using Python's Tkinter library to perform simple arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. 
The calculator provides a user-friendly graphical interface with buttons for numbers, operators, and functions like clear and backspace. 
This project demonstrates the integration of GUI elements with basic mathematical calculations in Python.
Implement advanced functions like sin, cos, tan, log, ln, square root, factorial, and reciprocal.
Incorporate constants like Ï€ and e, with the ability to compute powers of these constants.
Allow the user to switch between degrees and radians for trigonometric calculations.
Create a help menu that explains how to use the scientific functions, constants, and other special features.
Input is processed correctly and display the results of operations in real-time when "=" is pressed.
